API examples for vRSLCM 8.1

This reposotiry contains POSTMAN API examples to create vRLI, vROps, vRA and vRNI servers and clusters by triggering an API call to vRSLCM 8.1.

All POST or PUT API call have a JSON file on the BODY.
I have left the content in the JSON file to how I use it in my environment. I believe leaving the content "as is" it will be easier to comprehend what you need to modify in the JSON content.

Save the code as a JSON file and import into Postman.
